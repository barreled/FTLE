# This script will run an FTLE analysis on a set of ASCII files exported from DaVis.
# Output files will be a sequence of .vtk files that can be visualized in ParaView. 
# DaVis files should be named Bxxxxx.txt, with the "xxxxx" replaced by number startiong from 00001.
# The analysis will ignore any mask data when interpreting the velocity data.

# Clean up any old files before creating new ones
